Trampoline provides you with tools to easily setup, manage and index your Django models in ElasticSearch. It uses **celery** and is heavily reliant on **elasticsearch_dsl**.

It was designed to allow re-indexing of your documents without any downtime by using intermediary indices along with aliases.

## Installation

To install the package simply run:

```
pip install django-trampoline
```

## Settings

Add `trampoline` to your `INSTALLED_APPS`.

Define the setting:
```python
TRAMPOLINE = {
    'CONNECTIONS': {
        'default': {'hosts': 'localhost:9200'},
        # 'another_conn': {'hosts': 'localhost:9201'},
    },
    'INDICES': {
        'index_name': {
            'models': (
                'app_name.models.ModelName',
            ),
        }
    },
    'OPTIONS': {
        'fail_silently': True,
        'disabled': False,
    },
}
```

### HOST

`localhost` by default.

Address of your ElasticSearch host.

### INDICES

`{}` by default.

Each key inside `INDICES` represents an index which itself defines a list of `models` to be indexed.

### OPTIONS

#### fail_silently

`True` by default.

If `fail_silently` is `True` exceptions raised while indexing are caught and logged without being re-raised.

#### disabled

`False` by default.

## ESIndexableMixin

```python
from trampoline.mixins import ESIndexableMixin
```

In order to make your model indexable you must make it inherit from `ESIndexableMixin` and implement a few things.

#### es_doc_type (required)

Set the attribute `es_doc_type` with the corresponding `DocType` used to serialize your model.

#### get_es_doc_mapping (required)

```python
def get_es_doc_mapping(self):
    doc_type = self.es_doc_type()
    doc_type.foo = self.foo
    doc_type.bar = self.bar
    return doc_type
```

Return an instance of `es_doc_type` mapped with your current model instance.

#### is_indexable (optional)

```python
def is_indexable(self):
    return True
```

Tell whether a particular instance of the model should be indexed or skipped (defaults to true).

#### get_indexable_queryset (optional)

```python
@classmethod
def get_indexable_queryset(cls):
    return []
```

Return the list of contents that should be indexed for this model using the command `es_create_documents()` defined bellow. Make sure you don't forget the `classmethod` decorator.

## Management commands

All management commands accept the following arguments:
- **--help**: Display an help message and the available arguments for the command.
- **--dry-run**: Run the command in dry run mode without actually changing anything.
- **--verbosity**: 0 to 3 from least verbose to the most. Default to 1.

### es_create_index

Create a new index based on its definition inside `ES_SETTINGS`.

Arguments:
- **--index**: Name of the index as defined in the settings.
- **--target** *(optional)*: Name of the actual index created.

If **target** is not provided a unique name will be generated by appending the current timestamp to **index**.

### es_delete_index

Delete an index along with all the documents in it.

Arguments:
- **index**: Name of the index.
- **--yes** *(optional)*:  Bypass the command line's verification.

### es_create_alias

Create an alias from one index name to the other.

Arguments:
- **--index**: Name of the index as defined in the settings.
- **--target**: Name of the actual index.

### es_delete_alias

Delete an alias from one index name to the other.

Arguments:
- **--index**: Name of the index as defined in the settings.
- **--target**: Name of the actual index.
- **--yes** *(optional)*:  Bypass the command line's verification.

### es_create_documents

Create documents based on the method `get_indexable_queryset()` on the related models.

Arguments:
- **--index**: Name of the index as defined in the settings.
- **--target** *(optional)*: Name of the actual index.

**target** defaults to **index** if not provided.

## Pagination

A `Search` response cannot be as easily paginated as a `QuerySet` due to various constraints.

The best way to paginate a response is to use the custom paginator and view mixin provided with Trampoline.

### ESPaginationMixin

```python
from trampoline.views import ESPaginationMixin
```

In order to paginate your view you must make it inherit from `ESPaginationMixin` and implement a few things.

#### page_size (optional)

Set `page_size` to the desired number of results per page (defaults to 10).

#### get_search (required)

```python
def get_search(self):
  search = Search()
  ...
  return search
```

Return the `Search` object from which the response must be paginated.

Your view's `context_data` will then contain a `page` object as described bellow.

### Page

```python
from trampoline.paginator import Page
```

#### has_other_pages

Whether this is the last page of results or not.

#### hits

Paginated search results.

#### number

Corresponding page number.

#### paginator

Link back to the paginator from which the page is generated.

#### response

Search response.

#### total_count

Total number of results for the search.

### ESSearchPaginator

```python
from trampoline.paginator import ESSearchPaginator
```

You can also use the paginator on itself and outside of `ESPaginationMixin` if you ever need it. See the example bellow:

```python
page_size = 10
page_number = 2
search = Search()
...
paginator = ESSearchPaginator(search, page_size)
page = paginator.get_page(page_number)
```
